# Data Boundary Security Audit Report

**Date:** August 30, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** Issues Identified - Fixes Required

## Executive Summary

Critical data boundary violations have been identified in the quiz management system that allow students to potentially access quizzes from educators they are not associated with. This violates the fundamental security principle of data isolation between different educational organizations.

## Critical Findings

### 1. CRITICAL: Student Quiz List API Shows All Educator Quizzes
**Location:** `/src/app/api/student/quizzes/route.ts`

**Issue:** The API fetches quizzes based on educator relationships but DOES NOT verify that enrollments are limited to those educators.

**Current Flow:**
1. API gets student's educators from `educatorStudents` table
2. Fetches ALL published quizzes from those educators
3. Shows quizzes if student is enrolled, regardless of HOW they got enrolled

**Security Breach Scenario:**
- Student A (under Educator X) could be maliciously enrolled in Educator Y's quiz
- Student A would then see Educator Y's quiz in their dashboard
- This breaks organizational boundaries

### 2. HIGH: Enrollment APIs Lack Educator Ownership Validation
**Locations:** 
- `/src/app/api/educator/quiz/[id]/enroll/route.ts`
- `/src/app/api/educator/quiz/[id]/bulk-enroll/route.ts`

**Issue:** The enrollment endpoints verify quiz exists and student exists, but DO NOT verify:
- The educator making the request owns the quiz
- The student belongs to the educator's organization

**Current Implementation Problems:**
```typescript
// enroll/route.ts - Line 98-106
// No check that the educator making request owns this quiz!
// No check that student belongs to this educator!
await db.insert(enrollments).values({
  id: enrollmentId,
  quizId,
  studentId,
  enrolledAt: new Date(),
  status: "enrolled"
});
```

### 3. HIGH: Bulk Enrollment Only Partially Validates Relationships
**Location:** `/src/app/api/educator/quiz/[id]/bulk-enroll/route.ts`

**Issue:** While bulk enrollment DOES verify students belong to educator (lines 77-88), it still doesn't verify the requesting educator owns the quiz.

### 4. MEDIUM: No Organization/Institution Concept
**Database Schema Issue**

The system lacks an organizational boundary layer. Current structure:
- Educators directly linked to students
- No concept of schools/institutions
- Makes it impossible to enforce proper organizational boundaries

## Root Cause Analysis

### Design Flaws:
1. **Missing Authorization Layer:** APIs check authentication but not authorization
2. **Implicit Trust:** System assumes all enrollments are legitimate
3. **No Ownership Validation:** Quiz ownership is not verified before operations
4. **Missing Organization Model:** No institutional boundaries in database

### Data Flow Issues:
1. Student dashboard trusts enrollment data without verification
2. Enrollment creation doesn't validate educator-student relationships
3. Quiz visibility based solely on enrollment, not educator relationship

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Fixes (Priority 1)

#### Fix 1: Add Educator Authorization to Enrollment APIs
```typescript
// In enroll/route.ts and bulk-enroll/route.ts
const session = await auth.api.getSession({
  headers: await headers()
});

if (!session?.user || session.user.role !== 'educator') {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Unauthorized - Educator access required" },
    { status: 401 }
  );
}

// Verify educator owns the quiz
if (quiz[0].educatorId !== session.user.id) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Unauthorized - You don't own this quiz" },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

#### Fix 2: Validate Student-Educator Relationship Before Enrollment
```typescript
// Before creating enrollment, verify relationship
const relationship = await db
  .select()
  .from(educatorStudents)
  .where(
    and(
      eq(educatorStudents.educatorId, quiz[0].educatorId),
      eq(educatorStudents.studentId, studentId),
      eq(educatorStudents.status, "active")
    )
  )
  .limit(1);

if (!relationship.length) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Student is not associated with this educator" },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

#### Fix 3: Filter Student Quiz List by Valid Enrollments Only
```typescript
// In student/quizzes/route.ts
// Add enrollment validation to ensure enrollments match educator relationships
const validEnrollments = enrollments.filter(enrollment => {
  const quiz = quizzes.find(q => q.id === enrollment.quizId);
  return quiz && educatorIds.includes(quiz.educatorId);
});
```

### Medium-term Fixes (Priority 2)

#### Fix 4: Add Organization/Institution Layer
```sql
-- New table for organizations
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  domain TEXT,
  settings JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Link educators to organizations
ALTER TABLE user ADD COLUMN organization_id TEXT REFERENCES organizations(id);

-- Ensure students can only be linked to educators in same organization
```

#### Fix 5: Add Audit Logging for All Enrollments
```typescript
// Log all enrollment operations for security audit
await db.insert(activityLogs).values({
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  userId: session.user.id,
  actionType: 'enrollment_created',
  entityType: 'enrollment',
  entityId: enrollmentId,
  details: {
    quizId,
    studentId,
    educatorId: quiz[0].educatorId,
    method: 'manual_enroll'
  },
  createdAt: new Date()
});
```

### Long-term Fixes (Priority 3)

1. Implement proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
2. Add API rate limiting to prevent enrollment spam
3. Implement enrollment approval workflow for sensitive quizzes
4. Add data encryption for sensitive quiz content
5. Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Testing Requirements

### Test Cases to Implement:
1. ✅ Educator can only enroll their own students
2. ✅ Students only see quizzes from their educators
3. ✅ Cannot enroll student in another educator's quiz
4. ✅ Cannot bulk enroll students not belonging to educator
5. ✅ Invitation system respects educator boundaries
6. ✅ Quiz sharing links validate educator relationships

### Security Tests:
1. Attempt cross-educator enrollment via API
2. Verify SQL injection protection
3. Test authorization bypass attempts
4. Validate session hijacking protection

## Impact Assessment
