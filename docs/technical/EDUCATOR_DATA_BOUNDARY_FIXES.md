# Educator Data Boundary Security Fixes

**Date:** August 30, 2025  
**Issue:** Educators could see quiz data from other educators when viewing student profiles  
**Status:** FIXED

## Problem Summary

When an educator viewed a student's profile in their dashboard, they could see:
- Quiz attempts from OTHER educators' quizzes
- Results and scores from quizzes not owned by them
- Enrollment counts including other educators' quizzes

This was a critical data leakage issue where educator-to-educator boundaries were not properly enforced.

## Root Cause

The system correctly allowed students to belong to multiple educators (which is valid), but failed to filter data based on the viewing educator's ownership when displaying student information.

## Files Fixed

### 1. Student Detail View (`/api/educator/students/[id]/route.ts`)
**Problem:** Fetched ALL quiz attempts for a student regardless of quiz ownership  
**Fix:** 
- Added authentication requirement
- Filter enrollments to only show educator's own quizzes
- Filter quiz attempts to only show educator's own quizzes
- Calculate performance metrics only from educator's own quizzes

### 2. Students List View (`/api/educator/students/route.ts`)
**Problem:** Counted ALL enrollments and quiz completions across all educators  
**Fix:**
- Added joins to filter enrollment counts by educator's quizzes
- Added joins to filter completion counts by educator's quizzes
- Statistics now only reflect the educator's own quizzes

### 3. Educator Attempt Details (`/api/educator/attempt/[id]/route.ts`)
**Problem:** Authorization check was commented out!  
**Fix:**
- Enabled authentication requirement
- Added quiz ownership verification
- Educators can only view attempts for their own quizzes

### 4. Analytics API (`/api/educator/analytics/route.ts`)
**Problem:** Allowed testing without session  
**Fix:**
- Added authentication requirement
- Already had correct filtering by quiz ownership

### 5. Previously Fixed APIs
- **Enrollment API** (`/api/educator/quiz/[id]/enroll/route.ts`)
  - Added educator ownership validation
  - Added student-educator relationship validation
  
- **Bulk Enrollment API** (`/api/educator/quiz/[id]/bulk-enroll/route.ts`)
  - Added educator ownership validation
  - Fixed to use authenticated educator ID

- **Student Quiz List** (`/api/student/quizzes/route.ts`)
  - Filter to only show quizzes from student's educators
  
- **Educator Results API** (`/api/educator/quiz/[id]/results/route.ts`)
  - Added quiz ownership verification

## Security Improvements

### Data Isolation Achieved:
✅ Students can belong to multiple educators (valid use case)  
✅ Educators only see data from their own quizzes  
✅ Student statistics are scoped to the viewing educator  
✅ Quiz attempts are filtered by ownership  
✅ Enrollment counts are educator-specific  

### Key Principle:
**A student shared between educators should appear differently to each educator**, showing only the data relevant to that educator's quizzes and interactions.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Educator can only see their own quiz attempts in student details
- [x] Student statistics only count educator's own quizzes
- [x] Enrollment counts are educator-specific
- [x] Analytics only show educator's own data
- [x] Build passes without errors
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful

## Example Scenario

**Before Fix:**
- Student "John" belongs to Educator A and Educator B
- John completed 5 quizzes from Educator A and 3 from Educator B
- When Educator A viewed John's profile: Saw all 8 quiz attempts ❌
- When Educator B viewed John's profile: Saw all 8 quiz attempts ❌

**After Fix:**
- When Educator A views John's profile: Sees only 5 quiz attempts ✅
- When Educator B views John's profile: Sees only 3 quiz attempts ✅

## Deployment Notes

These are critical security fixes that should be deployed immediately:
1. No database migrations required
2. All changes are API-level filtering
3. Backward compatible
4. No frontend changes needed

## Future Recommendations

1. **Add Organization Layer**: Implement institutional boundaries for better multi-tenant isolation
2. **Audit Logging**: Log all cross-boundary access attempts
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent enumeration attacks
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule quarterly security reviews
5. **Automated Tests**: Add integration tests for boundary violations

## Summary

The educator data boundary issues have been completely resolved. The system now properly maintains data isolation between different educators while still allowing students to belong to multiple educators. Each educator sees only the data relevant to their own quizzes and interactions with students.
